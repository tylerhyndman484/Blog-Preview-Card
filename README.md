## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Pseudo Elements

### What I learned

I was able to use box shadow for the first time. It was nice to get a feel for that and use the pseduo element of :hover as well.

```css
.card {
    background-color: var(--card-backgound-color);
    box-shadow: .5rem .5rem;
    border: black 1px solid;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue my usage of custom properties and get more accustom you using them.
